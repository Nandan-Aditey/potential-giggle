                <br>To get a better understanding of the pathway, and to be able to predict the efficiency of the genetically modified bacterium under different conditions, we built a kinetic model on COPASI. Based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which upon being given input of various factors such as fertilizer added, initial bacterial amount, etc. the model would be able to predict the decrease in N loss, and the final amounts of ammonium and nitrate taken up by the plant.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    As a part of ARGUS-2440, we aim to convert mobile nitrate present in the soil into ammonium, which is retained in soil, to reduce the nitrogen loss in soil and increase fertilizer efficiency.
                    Although several soil bacteria perform nitrate ammonification in soil, we have designed a novel bacterium to selectively perform this pathway under any soil conditions of oxygen content, pH, soil type, etc.
                </p>
                    
                <h3 id="reason">Why Make a Model?</h3>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    We decided to build this kinetic model to get a better idea of how our modified bacterium's efficiency will change according to different initial conditions of initial nitrate & ammonium concentration, bacterial population, rate of nitrate & ammonium uptake, rate of leaching, and cellular enzyme concentration. 
                </p>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    Given, as input, ideal conditions required for the growth of a certain plant in a certain soil type, over a certain time frame, this model will aid in giving the required amount of fertilizer and initial bacterial volume to be added to give the desired result.

                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    To simulate the pathway, we used the following backbone in the figure, based on a similar backbone put forth by Huang et al, 2020, in the closely related strain <em>P. putida Y-9</em>, which performs nitrate ammonification.

                                For any given scenario, the extracellular ammonium concentration will be higher than the extracellular nitrate concentration since the bacteria are producing ammonium and consuming nitrate, and the nitrate is also being leached away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since utilisation of ammonium is more energy efficient and the external ammonium concentration is higher than that of nitrate, we assume that the bacteria preferentially grow on ammonium. Thus, the growth rate depends solely on the ammonium concentration.

                            <p>Due to the very long timescales being considered in the model, the growth of ammonium according to the Monod equation gives highly inaccurate values, the extracellular medium always contains ammonium, and would predict growth of bacterial culture to extremely high values.

                                However, this is not possible since the growth of the bacterium is fundamentally dependent on the carbon source, which is present in only a limited amount, and cannot sustain such growth. Instead, the growth would be better characterized by a logistic-like growth.

                                Hence, for the sake of getting meaningful results, we assumed that the bacterium stops growing past a certain carrying capacity, here arbitrarily assumed to be a total population volume of 10<sup>-4</sup>L.

                                Since the kinetics of this inhibition have not been studied well, we assumed that beyond a cellular concentration of 1mM ammonium, the cell stops importing ammonium, ie, T<sub>m1, NH<sub>4</sub></sub> = 0.

                              When inputting the rates of nitrate leaching and uptake of ammonium & nitrate, we assumed constant rates for the sake of simplicity, which we could make more accurate later on.

                              We also assumed the rates of ammonium and nitrate uptake are equal, and assigned them to value of 10<sup>-11</sup> mol/s for the given extracellular volume, based on average values from literature, of N uptake rates by tomato plants, and assuming root weight density of about 1g/L

                             We assigned the value of the rate of leaching depending on the test case. Say that in conditions without our bacterium, 45% of N in fertilizer is lost (assumed to be lost solely through nitrate leaching), meaning that about 90% of nitrate was leached– rate of leaching is 9x that of uptake, i.e., 9*10<sup>-11</sup>mol/s.</p>

                              While estimating the enzyme concentration, since we don't have any wet lab results yet, we assigned the values of the concentrations to be similar to the concentrations of some housekeeping genes naturally present in <em>P.putida</em>.

                              For most cases in the model we assumed about 1000 proteins per cell, individual cell volume to be about 10<sup>-15</sup>L, we get a protein concentration of 1.67*10<sup>-6</sup>mol/L.

                              Eventually this value can be replaced with real values obtained from wet lab.

                    Running the initial model, which did not account for nitrate leaching and N uptake by plant root, after about ~30 days, about 98% of nitrate is transformed into ammonium which can be taken up by the soil, and stabilizes at this value (the remaining was assimilated into GS/GOGAT cycles of the bacterium).

                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    We considered the following test case: 5mg of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> fertilizer was added to a selected volume of medium (0.125L). By mass, this is equivalent to 1.125 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and 3.875 mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, or 0.5 mM each. The scenario assumes a nutrient absorption rate of 10<sup>-11</sup> mol/s and a leaching rate of 9 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> mol/s.

                    Without our bacterium in the soil, all the ammonium is taken up by the plant after 1.58 years (5 &times; 10<sup>7</sup>s). However, only one-tenth of the nitrate is taken up, resulting in a <strong>45% loss of the total applied nitrogen</strong>.

                    In this scenario, all extracellular ammonium is taken up by the plant, and only 0.11 mM of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is lost. This represents a total nitrogen loss of <strong>only 11%</strong>, a significant improvement.

                <h2 class="section-title">How our Model can be used by Farmers</h2>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    Imagine a farmer who wants to use our genetically engineered bacterium in soil to reduce the N loss in their field and decrease the damage done to the nearby ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    For a given soil type and plant species, our model would be able to give the optimal amounts of fertilizer and bacterial volume to be added, for the plant to be able to uptake an amount of N that would be tailored to its growth needs, while minimizing loss by leaching.
                </p>
                <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                    How would it do this? We vary the inputs across a range of possible values, for given rates of uptake and leaching. Then, we will find the optimal condition (i.e., the one with least N loss and optimal N uptake) using flux balance analysis (steady state assumed to occur when all the ammonium and nitrate in medium has been depleted) to give the ideal input.
