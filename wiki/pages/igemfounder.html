        <p>In early March, the team got an unexpected and exciting opportunity to meet iGEM founders, Drew Endy and Randy Rettberg. They were in Bangalore for a scientific conference and expressed their wish to meet current and previous iGEMers from IISc. The meeting was arranged with just a few days' notice, leaving us with little time to prepare but plenty of anticipation.</p>

        <p>Naturally, we prepared for all the possible questions they might ask about our project, debated our funding situation, and even wrung our brains about the dress code. Above all, we were thrilled to meet such established scientists.</p>

        <h2>A Meeting of Minds</h2>
        <p>As it turned out, we didn’t have to fret. The founders were incredibly friendly and immediately created a stimulating environment for a passionate discussion about science, well beyond just the scope of iGEM. Along with the founders, we got to meet other inspiring people from the synbio community, including Nelson Vadassery, co-founder of a Bangalore-based seaweed company; Sanjeevani Marcha of String Bio; and John Cumbers, founder of the global company SynBioBeta.</p>

        <p>Engaging conversations flowed as the scientists and founders narrated anecdotes of similar meetings with other iGEM teams over the years, sharing stories from their lives and research.</p>
        
        <blockquote>They prompted us to share specific moments when science had particularly inspired us.</blockquote>
        
        <p>Different experiences were shared, ranging from a Khan Academy video sparking a previously unthought-of question, to how recent Microbiology lectures instilled that no idea in science is too complex, but simply the next logical question. One team member even recounted how investigating baby lizards under a microscope had been a truly eye-opening experience.</p>

        <h2>The Story of iGEM</h2>
        <p>The conversation gradually shifted to the frustrations in academia and the technology surrounding it. More often than not, scientific papers tend to be badly written, and the founders empathized with our plight. They shared the story of how iGEM came to be and spoke fondly of past teams who had perfectly captured the essence of iGEM's principles. They motivated us in our path of ideation and gave key advice on how to approach both iGEM and academia in general.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways from the Meeting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passion is paramount:</strong> The most successful projects are driven by genuine curiosity and a desire to solve a real problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Storytelling matters:</strong> Clearly communicating the "why" behind your project is just as important as the science itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace the community:</strong> iGEM is about collaboration. Learning from past teams and engaging with experts is a core part of the experience.</li>
            </ul>
