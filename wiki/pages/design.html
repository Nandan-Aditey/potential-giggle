                <h3>Vector Integration Strategy</h3>
                    <p>We planned to insert these operons primarily into the pSEVA vector 648. Since all SEVA plasmids have the same order of restriction enzymes in their insertion region, we added restriction sites to the ends of the operons according to the order in which they were present in the plasmids.</strong>. Fortunately, all SEVA plasmids have the same order of restriction enzymes in their insertion region, so we added restriction enzymes to the operons accordingly.</p>

                    <p>We chose the enzymes EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII due to their availability in our lab. We were getting our genes synthesized via TWIST Bioscience, and they had a limit of 5000 bp per plasmid. The <em>nirBD</em> operon fits neatly into this limit.</p>

                    <p>The <em>nrf</em> operons, however, are much bigger. We thus broke them up into two parts each, therefore building four gene fragments:</p>

                    <p>They could then be digested together and inserted into the plasmid. Following is a demonstration of how this would be achieved for <em>nrfABCDEFG</em> and pSEVA648.</p>

                         style="display: block; margin: 1rem auto 0; max-width: 800px; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 2rem;">

                    <p>Another point to note is the inducible nature of the XylS<em>/Pm</em> promoter. Since it is induced by benzoate, a plant root exudate, the engineered bacterium would only be able to express nitrite reductase when it is in close proximity to the plant roots. If the bacteria were to escape the rhizosphere, the operon would simply shut off, meaning it would populate the soil as any other common soil bacterium. Our pseudo-kill switch control mechanism was thus characterised.</p>

            <section id="gene-editing" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h2>Gene Editing</h2>
                <p>While our chassis was <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> KT2440, we were advised by Prof Umesh Varshney to demonstrate our plasmids in E.coli first for ease of handling. This meant that we had to optimise our genes for expression in both organisms separately.</p>

                <p> Our method of choice was to use the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), suggested to us by Ramesh Vaidyanathan at TWIST Bioscience. Each amino acid can be encoded by several different codons, but organisms often show specific biases, meaning they use certain codons more frequently than others for the same amino acid. These are called <strong>optimal codons</strong>. A gene with a high CAI score primarily uses these optimal codons in reference to that particular organism, suggesting it can be translated quickly and produce a large amount of protein. Conversely, a low CAI score indicates the use of rare codons, which can slow down translation and hinder protein production.</p>

                <p>
                    The sequences were then cross-checked for the presence of EcorI, BamHI, and HindIII within the genes, and we manually changed triplet codes to express the same amino acids when we found these instances.

            <section id="assay-designs" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h2>Assay Designs</h2>
                <p>While designing the concentrations and compositions of the various assays, we kept the following broad questions in mind:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> What C/N ratio(s) is/are best for our particular strain?</li>
                    <li> Is nitrite ammonification more preferred in broth or spread on agar? What can we infer from these results to qualitatively describe the oxygen-dependence of NarL, the native promoter vs XylS<em>/Pm</em>, our inducible promoter?</li>
                    <li> What, if any, is the threshold beyond which nitrite concentration/build-up proves detrimental (stunted growth, death, other observable phenomena)?</li>
                    <li> What, if any, is the threshold beyond which ammonium concentration/build-up proves detrimental (stunted growth, death, other observable phenomena)?</li>
                    <li> Could the presence of a nitrite transporter in <em>P. putida</em> KT2440 at least be inferred through the graph trends?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Biofilm assays</h3>
                <p>Our major goals with biofilm testing were two-fold:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Quantifying the native biofilm-production capabilities of <em>P. putida</em> KT2440.</li>
                    <li>Quantifying the biofilm-production capabilities of the transformed bacterium.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since laboratory testing of biofilm production requires the use of a stressor, we planned to use tetracycline to induce biofilm formation.
                </p>
                <h3>Ammonium testing assays</h3>
                <p>Our major goal was to test for extracellular ammonium levels in the bacterial culture, since intracellular ammonium could be attributed to the assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway and simply calculated by subtracting initial total nitrogen amounts in the culture media. We decided to use the indophenol test with Berthelot’s reagent, the specifics of which are available in the Experimentation page.</p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, to cross-check our results and verify their reproducibility, we designed assays using the traditional phenol reagent as well as a modified salicylic acid substitute.
                </p>
                <h3>Nitrite testing assays</h3>
                <p>
                We purchased the Merck nitrite testing kit for colorimetric analysis of nitrite amounts in the culture media pre- and post-bacterial treatment.

            <section id="soil-biorem" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h2>Soil bioremediation</h2>
                <p>We reached out to the researchers in the group Biofunctool at our institute to understand more about their work related to nitrate quantification in soil. This directed us to Berambadi village, one of their major testing sites, where they conducted periodic testing on soil samples. We have analyzed their work and displayed the statistics on our home page. 
                </p>
                <div class="callout callout-note">
                        <p>
                            Their work inspired us to collect our own soil and water samples from a wider geographic area and quantify nitrate levels across the country. Our team members brought back soil samples from their homes after the summer, and we have collaborated with Prof Sumanta Bagchi’s lab to conduct nitrate quantification tests on them. This is an effort to contextualise the problem even further, and to stress the need for a timely solution like ours.

                <h2>Water bioremediation</h2>
                <p>A major advantage of our design is its flexibility. Every piece of the puzzle can be switched out for something that could confer a different functionality. For example, we can easily switch to a facultative anaerobe or an obligate anaerobe to perform this pathway in water. Since most DNRA bacteria have been isolated from waterlogged fields, protein functionality would not be an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, we can change the inducible promoter to respond to any inducer of our choice. This could tailor our solution to specific plants based on root exudates, and specific water bodies based on algal toxins or geographic location-specific molecules.
